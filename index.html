	<p>Hi, I am physicist. I've got my MSc in Physics from  Novosibirsk State University in 1977 and PhD in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics from Institute of Nuclear Physics in 1984 (both in Novosibirsk, Russia). Still in Novosibirsk I enjoyed doing theoretical physics for 15 years, but, after moving to Israel in 1992, I've found myself as an industrial physicist and I've  worn this hat for all these years. 
	</p>
	    <p>What a theoretical physicist can do in industry? Computations, algorithm
	    development, data analysis, simulations, optimizations. I like computers and I've been working with them
	    since my university days, so the switch was relatively easy for me. I worked for several high technology 
	    companies 	     but decided to start a new life as an independent industrial physicist and founded SPIPS, which stands for Shimon Panfil: Industrial Physics and Simulations.
	    </p>
